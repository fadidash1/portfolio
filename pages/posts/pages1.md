# KEEP THE LINE

## WASTE NO MORE TIME

###### ***THE IDEA** **IN SIMPLE TERM***

The app as solution:

A simple mobile App where Taker can send another Keeper to do the queue and when itâ€™s almost his turn he could communicate **on** with the **Taker**.

The pain where the idia has born:

Have you ever  lost your whole day waiting  in a queue in a public offices ...

The main target to avoid the pain:

Students and workers when they have some document to do in  public offices and they are forced to skip their job shifts or lessons.
